JUST THROWING A IDEA OUT THERE....

In a world powered by technology, war has evolved from guns to computers. 
Where hackers can lauch missiles remotely with the click of a button and identies can be stolen within a few minutes.
The world is no longer safe and it is up to you to decide who you want to be, the man who protects the innocent, or the man who steals from them!

^^^That would be within a menu where you could decide your “team” in BOT.net and the two options would be (white hats) protecting the innocent and (black hats) stealing from the innocent.
